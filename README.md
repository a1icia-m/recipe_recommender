## Description
ðŸ¥— An AI-powered smart recipe search platform that helps users discover personalized meals from a database of 520,000+ recipes from Food.com.  

I built this tool because I wanted a faster way to find recipes using leftover ingredients in my fridge while still meeting my gym macro goals like high protein and low sugar! 

The app uses FastAPI and Streamlit, and intelligently parses natural language queries through fuzzy matching, semantic search (FAISS + SentenceTransformers), and zero-shot classification from a model I trained with sci-kit learn to filter by dietary preferences. Whether you're meal planning or tracking nutrition, this system makes healthy eating easier, smarter, and more aligned with your fitness goals.
